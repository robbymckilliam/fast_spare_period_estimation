The paper presents a novel technique for estimating the period of a point process in presence of noise and missing observations. While well-known techniques based on least-squares (LS) method and periodogram calculation incur in a computational burden that scales quadratically with the data size, the proposed techniques has a computational complexity that scales as N (log N) where N is the data size. The crux of the proposed algorithm is a fine quantization of the point process, which enables evaluation of the periodogram via, e.g., fast Fourier transform. Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed showing that, in certain cases, the initial quantizations does not strongly impair performances.

The paper is well written and it can be accepted after the following minor changes are addressed:

1) The identifiability claim at the beginning of sec. II is not obvious and a reference is mandatory. Indeed, referring to eq. (2), let us assume that s_n = 2 i_n where i_n are all non-negative integer. In this case the point process is periodic with period 2T_0. This referee does not believe that maximizing the periodogram over (f_min,f_max) will identify the true frequency (or period). LS methods might have the capabilities to identify the period, but, in any case the claim of idenitifiability needs to be further supported.

2) Is the equality in the second (un-numbered) equation of page 2 correct?

3) Newton-Rapson iteration to further improve the frequency estimation is advocated in Sec. II. Can a reference supporting this statement be added?

4) Referring to Fig. 3, in case N=30, the novel method incurs in a significant loss of performance with respect to classical LS and periodogram for low-signal-to-noise ratios. In this scenario (low N and low signal-to-noise-ration) relevant for real applications?
